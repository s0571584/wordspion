# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WortSpion is a Flutter-based social deduction game where players try to identify spies among them. Players know a common word while spies receive a similar "deception word." The app supports both single-device mode for local gatherings and multiplayer mode using Supabase for remote play.

## Development Commands

### Build & Code Generation
- **Generate routes**: `./build.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `build_routes.bat` (Windows)
  - Runs `flutter pub get` and `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
  - Required when adding new routes with @RoutePage() annotations
- **Standard Flutter commands**:
  - `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
  - `flutter run` - Run the app
  - `flutter analyze` - Static analysis
  - `flutter test` - Run tests
  - `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK

### Testing
- Uses `bloc_test` for BLoC testing and `mockito` for mocking
- Widget tests available in `test/` directory

## Architecture & Project Structure

### State Management - BLoC Pattern
The app uses flutter_bloc with clear separation of concerns:
- **BLoCs**: `/lib/blocs/` - Business logic components organized by feature
  - `GameBloc` - Game state and flow management
  - `PlayerBloc` - Player management 
  - `RoundBloc` - Round logic and scoring
  - `VotingBloc` - Voting mechanics
  - `SettingsBloc` - Game configuration
  - `TimerBloc` - Timer functionality
  - `PlayerGroupBloc` - Player group management
  - `AuthBloc` - User authentication and profile management
  - `MultiplayerGameBloc` - Multiplayer game room and real-time synchronization
- Each BLoC has dedicated event, state, and bloc files

### Data Layer
- **Models**: `/lib/data/models/` - Data entities (Game, Player, Round, UserProfile, GameRoom, etc.)
- **Repositories**: `/lib/data/repositories/` - Data access abstraction
  - Local repositories for single-device mode (SQLite)
  - Multiplayer repositories for online mode (Supabase)
- **Local Storage**: SQLite via `sqflite` with `DatabaseHelper` singleton
- **Remote Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
- **Word Data**: Static word collections in `/lib/data/sources/local/`

### Dependency Injection
- Uses `get_it` for service location in `/lib/di/injection_container.dart`
- Repositories registered as lazy singletons
- BLoCs registered as factories for fresh instances
- Initialize via `di.init()` in main.dart

### Routing
- **Auto Route**: Uses `auto_route` package for type-safe navigation
- Routes defined in `/lib/core/router/app_router.dart`
- Generated code in `app_router.gr.dart` (requires build_runner)
- All screens require `@RoutePage()` annotation

### UI Structure
- **Screens**: `/lib/presentation/screens/` - Full-screen widgets
- **Widgets**: `/lib/presentation/widgets/` - Reusable UI components
- **Themes**: `/lib/presentation/themes/` - Centralized styling (colors, typography, spacing)
- Uses Material Design with custom `AppTheme.lightTheme`

### Key Services
- **ScoreCalculator**: Game scoring logic in `/lib/core/services/`
- **TimerService**: Round timer management
- **MultiplayerGameService**: Multiplayer game logic (role assignment, scoring, game flow)
- **Word Selection Utils**: Category and word management utilities

## Development Notes

### Database Schema
- **Local (SQLite)**: Single-device mode with tables: categories, words, word_relations, games, players, rounds, votes, player_groups
- **Remote (Supabase PostgreSQL)**: Multiplayer mode with tables: user_profiles, game_rooms, room_players, rounds, player_roles, votes, word_guesses, game_events
- Version management via `DatabaseConstants.databaseVersion`
- Complete RLS (Row Level Security) policies for multiplayer data protection

### Platform Support
- Cross-platform: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS
- Desktop platforms use `sqflite_common_ffi`
- Portrait orientation locked via SystemChrome

### Asset Management
- Images: `/assets/images/` with role-specific subdirectories
- Fonts: Montserrat family in `/assets/fonts/`
- Icons: Generated via `flutter_launcher_icons`

### Code Generation Requirements
When adding new routes, models, or changing auto_route annotations:
1. Run the build script to regenerate code
2. Ensure @RoutePage() annotations are properly added to screen classes
3. Import new routes in app_router.dart

### Game Flow Architecture
**Single-device mode**: Home â†’ Game Setup â†’ Category Selection â†’ Player Registration â†’ Role Reveal â†’ Game Play â†’ Voting â†’ Results. Each screen is managed by its corresponding BLoC, with game state persisted in SQLite.

**Multiplayer mode**: Home â†’ Auth (Login/Signup) â†’ Create/Join Room â†’ Lobby â†’ Role Reveal â†’ Game Play â†’ Voting â†’ Results. Real-time synchronization via Supabase, with offline fallback.

## Multiplayer Integration Progress

### âœ… Completed (Phase 1 - Database & Core Setup)
- **Branch**: `feature/multiplayer-integration`
- **Database**: Complete Supabase schema (13 SQL files in `/database/`)
  - Tables: user_profiles, game_rooms, room_players, rounds, player_roles, votes, etc.
  - Row Level Security policies for data protection
  - Helper functions and triggers for automation
- **Flutter Integration**: 
  - Supabase dependency and configuration (`/lib/core/config/supabase_config.dart`)
  - Multiplayer data models (GameRoom, RoomPlayer, UserProfile, etc.)
  - Repository pattern for Supabase integration
  - Authentication and multiplayer game BLoCs
  - Updated dependency injection container

### âœ… Completed (Phase 2 - UI & Authentication)

- Create `.env` file with Supabase credentials:
  ```
  SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
  ```

#### 2. Dependencies & Build
- Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
