# WortSpion Multi-Round Scoring System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive multi-round scoring system to WortSpion that tracks player scores across multiple rounds, displays intermediate results, and determines a final winner.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Scoring Logic
- **ScoreCalculator Service**: Calculates points based on game outcomes
  - Team members: +2 points for identifying all spies, -1 if falsely accused
  - Spies: +3 points for remaining undetected, +2 bonus for guessing the word
  - Skip to Results: Spies automatically win with +3 points

### 2. Data Models
- **RoundScoreResult**: Tracks score changes for each player per round
- Updated database schema with round_results table for persistence

### 3. BLoC Updates
- **RoundBloc**: Now calculates and stores scores when completing rounds
- **GameBloc**: Handles multi-round progression and determines final winners
- Updated events and states to support scoring data

### 4. New UI Screens
- **RoundResultsScreen**: Shows outcome and score changes after each round
- **FinalResultsScreen**: Displays final rankings and winner
- Visual score indicators with +/- notation and color coding

### 5. Database Enhancements
- Updated `round_results` table schema to store detailed score information
- New repository methods for score management
- Database version incremented to support new schema

### 6. Navigation Flow
- Voting → Round Results → Next Round (Role Reveal) or Final Results
- Proper state management between screens using RoundResultsState
- Auto-router integration with custom routes

11. `lib/data/sources/local/database_helper.dart` - Updated schema
12. `lib/core/constants/database_constants.dart` - Incremented version

## Key Implementation Details

### Scoring Rules
- Points are calculated based on game outcomes and player roles
- Team wins when all spies are correctly identified with no false accusations
- Spies win when at least one remains undetected
- Word guessing provides bonus points for spies

### State Management
- RoundResultsState singleton manages data transfer between screens
- BLoC pattern maintained for consistent state management
- Database persistence ensures scores survive app restarts

### Navigation
- Custom auto-router implementation for new screens
- State-based navigation ensures proper data flow
- Back button disabled on result screens to prevent navigation issues

### Database Migration
- Version 3 includes updated round_results table
- Supports both old and new score tracking systems
- Automatic migration on app update

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Scoring Scenarios**:
   - Test all winning conditions (team vs spy victories)
   - Verify word guessing bonus points
   - Test "Skip to Results" functionality

2. **Multi-Round Flow**:
   - Verify scores accumulate correctly across rounds
   - Test navigation between rounds
   - Ensure final results display correctly

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single round games
   - Maximum player counts
   - Tied scores
   - Database migration from older versions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Scoring**:
   - Time-based bonuses
   - Streak bonuses for consecutive wins
   - Difficulty multipliers

2. **Statistics**:
   - Player performance tracking
   - Win/loss ratios
   - Historical game data

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Animated score changes
   - Sound effects for scoring
   - Achievement system

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the multi-round scoring system while maintaining the existing game architecture and user experience.
